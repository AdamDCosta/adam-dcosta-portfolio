# My Web Development Portfolio

This is my portfolio of projects built during my time on the full-time *_nology* web development course. In week three of the course we were tasked with creating a portfolio to house our projects - which you can see [here](https://adamdcosta.github.io/My-portfolio/). After learning React I then decided to go back and rebuild my portfolio as I wanted to build on the skills picked up during the React segment of the course.

## Tech stack
