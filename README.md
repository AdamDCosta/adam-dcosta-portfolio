# My Web Development Portfolio

This is my portfolio of projects built during my time on the full-time *_nology* web development course. In week three of the course we were tasked with creating a portfolio to house our projects - which you can see [here](https://adamdcosta.github.io/My-portfolio/). After learning React I then decided to go back and rebuild my portfolio as I wanted to build on the skills picked up during the React segment of the course.

## About

I wanted to build on the idea of reusable components, reducing the amount of hard-coded pages and adding more dynamically created content than my previous portfolio. One way I did this was to create a data JS file - an array of objects - of my projects. This way I could pass the data as props, and create a function that mapped through the data and rendered and project 'card' for each one.
